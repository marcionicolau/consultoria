## Overview

To create a [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentation from R Markdown you specify the `revealjs_presentation` output format in the front-matter of your document. You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the `#` and
`##` heading tags (you can also create a new slide without a header
using a horizontal rule (`----`). For example here's a simple
slide show:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: revealjs_presentation
    ---

    # In the morning

    ## Getting up

    - Turn off alarm
    - Get out of bed

    ## Breakfast

    - Eat eggs
    - Drink coffee

    # In the evening

    ## Dinner

    - Eat spaghetti
    - Drink wine

    ----

    ## Going to sleep

    - Get in bed
    - Count sheep

## Display Modes

The following single character keyboard shortcuts enable alternate
display modes:

-   `'f'` enable fullscreen mode

-   `'o'` enable overview mode

Pressing `Esc` exits all of these modes.

## Incremental Bullets

You can render bullets incrementally by adding the `incremental` option:

    ---
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        incremental: true
    ---

If you want to render bullets incrementally for some slides but not
others you can use this syntax:

    > - Eat eggs
    > - Drink coffee

## Appearance and Style

There are several options that control the appearance of revealjs presentations:

* `theme` specifies the theme to use for the presentation (available themes are "default", "simple", "sky", "beige", "serif", or "solarized").

* `transition` specifies the visual effect when moving between slides. Available transitions are "default", "cube", "page", "concave", "zoom", "linear", "fade", or "none".

* `highlight` specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", and "haddock". Pass null to prevent syntax highlighting.

* `center` specifies whether you want to vertically center content on slides (this defaults to false).

* `smart` indicates whether to produce typographically correct output, converting straight quotes to curly quotes, `---` to em-dashes, `--` to en-dashes, and `...` to ellipses. Note that `smart` is enabled by default.

For example:

    ---
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        theme: sky
        transition: fade
        highlight: pygments
        center: true
    ---

## Figure Options

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within reveal.js presentations:

* `fig_width` and  `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (7x5 is used by default)

* `fig_retina` Specifies the scaling to perform for retina displays (defaults to 2, which currently works for all widely used retina displays). Note that this only takes effect if you are using knitr >= 1.5.21. Set to `null` to prevent retina scaling.

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        fig_width: 7
        fig_height: 6
        fig_caption: true
    ---


## MathJax Equations

By default [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) scripts are included in reveal.js presentations for rendering LaTeX and MathML equations. You can use the `mathjax` option to control how MathJax is included:

* Specify "default" to use an https URL from the official MathJax CDN.

* Specify "local" to use a local version of MathJax (which is copied into the output directory). Note that when using "local" you also need to set the `self_contained` option to false.

* Specify an alternate URL to load MathJax from another location.

* Specify null to exclude MathJax entirely.

For example, to use a local copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        mathjax: local
        self_contained: false
    ---

To use a self-hosted copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        mathjax: "http://example.com/mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
    ---

To exclude MathJax entirely:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        mathjax: null
    ---

## Document Dependencies

By default R Markdown produces standalone HTML files with no external dependencies, using data: URIs to incorporate the contents of linked scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos. This means you can share or publish the file just like you share Office documents or PDFs. If you'd rather have keep depenencies in external files you can specify `self_contained: false`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        self_contained: false
    ---

Note that even for self contained documents MathJax is still loaded externally (this is necessary because of it's size). If you want to serve MathJax locally then you should specify `mathjax: local` and `self_contained: false`.

One common reason keep dependencies external is for serving R Markdown documents from a website (external dependencies can be cached separately by browsers leading to faster page load times). In the case of serving multiple R Markdown documents you may also want to consolidate dependent library files (e.g. Bootstrap, MathJax, etc.) into a single directory shared by multiple documents. You can use the `lib_dir` option to do this, for example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        self_contained: false
        lib_dir: libs
    ---

## Advanced Customization

### Includes

You can do more advanced customization of output by including additional HTML content or by replacing the core pandoc template entirely. To include content in the document header or before/after the document body you use the `includes` option as follows:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        includes:
          in_header: header.html
          before_body: doc_prefix.html
          after_body: doc_suffix.html
    ---

### Custom Templates

You can also replace the underlying pandoc template using the `template` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        template: quarterly_report.html
    ---

Consult the documentation on [pandoc templates](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/templates.html) for additional details on templates. You can also study the [default HTML template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.html) as an example.

### Pandoc Arguments

If there are pandoc features you want to use that lack equivilants in the YAML options described above you can still use them by passing custom `pandoc_args`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      revealjs_presentation:
        pandoc_args: [
          "--title-prefix", "Foo",
          "--id-prefix", "Bar"
        ]
    ---

Documentation on all available pandoc arguments can be found in the [pandoc user guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#options).

## Shared Options

If you want to specify a set of default options to be shared by multiple documents within a directory you can include a file named `_output.yaml` within the directory. Note that no YAML delimeters or enclosing output object are used in this file. For example:

**\_output.yaml**

```yaml
revealjs_presentation:
  theme: sky
  transition: fade
  highlight: pygments
```

All documents located in the same directory as `_output.yaml` will inherit it's options. Options defined explicitly within documents will override those specified in the shared options file.
