## Overview

To create an [ioslides](https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/) presentation from R Markdown you specify the `ioslides_presentation` output format in the front-matter of your document. You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the `#` and
`##` heading tags (you can also create a new slide without a header
using a horizontal rule (`----`). For example here's a simple
slide show:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: ioslides_presentation
    ---

    # In the morning

    ## Getting up

    - Turn off alarm
    - Get out of bed

    ## Breakfast

    - Eat eggs
    - Drink coffee

    # In the evening

    ## Dinner

    - Eat spaghetti
    - Drink wine

    ----

    ![picture of spaghetti](images/spaghetti.jpg)

    ## Going to sleep

    - Get in bed
    - Count sheep

You can add a subtitle to a slide or section by including text after the
pipe (|) character. For example:

    ## Getting up | What I like to do first thing

## Display Modes

The following single character keyboard shortcuts enable alternate
display modes:

-   `'f'` enable fullscreen mode

-   `'w'` toggle widescreen mode

-   `'o'` enable overview mode

-   `'h'` enable code highlight mode

-   `'p'` show presenter notes

Pressing `Esc` exits all of these modes. See the sections below on *Code
Highlighting* and *Presenter Mode* for additional detail on those modes.

## Incremental Bullets

You can render bullets incrementally by adding the `incremental` option:

    ---
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        incremental: true
    ---

If you want to render bullets incrementally for some slides but not
others you can use this syntax:

    > - Eat eggs
    > - Drink coffee

## Visual Appearance

### Presentation Size

You can display the presentation using a wider form factor using the
`widescreen` option. You can specify that smaller text be used with the
`smaller` option. For example:

    ---
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        widescreen: true
        smaller: true
    ---

You can also enable the `smaller` option on a slide-by-slide basis by
adding the `.smaller` attribute to the slide header:

    ## Getting up {.smaller}

### Transition Speed

You can customize the speed of slide transitions using `transition` option. This can be "default", "slower", "faster", or a numeric value with a number of seconds (e.g. 0.5) . For example:

    ---
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        transition: slower
    ---

### Build Slides

Slides can also have a `.build` attribute that indicate that their
content should be displayed incrementally. For example:

    ## Getting up {.build}

Slide attributes can be combined if you need to specify more than one,
for example:

    ## Getting up {.smaller .build}

### Adding a Logo

You can add a logo to the presentation using the `logo` option (the logo
should be square and at least 128x128). For example:

    ---
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        logo: logo.png
    ---

A 128x128 version of the logo graphic will be added to the title slide
and an icon version of the logo will be included in the bottom-left
footer of each slide.

### Custom CSS

You can add your own CSS to an ioslides presentation using the `css` option:

    ---
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        css: styles.css
    ---

You can also target specific slides or classes of slice with custom CSS by adding ids or classes to the slides headers within your document. For example the following slide
header:

    ## Next Steps {#nextsteps .emphasized}

Would enable you to apply CSS to all of it's content using either of the following CSS selectors:

    #nextsteps {
       color: blue;
    }

    .emphasized {
       font-size: 1.2em;
    }


## Code Highlighting

It's possible to select subsets of code for additional emphasis by
adding a special "highlight" comment around the code. For example:

    ### <b>
    x <- 10
    y <- x * 2
    ### </b>

The highlighted region will be displayed with a bold font. When you want
to help the audience focus exclusively on the highlighted region press
the `'h'` key and the rest of the code will fade away.

## Tables

The ioslides template has an attractive default style for tables so you
shouldn't hesitate to add tables for presenting more complex sets of
information. Pandoc markdown supports several syntaxes for defining
tables which are described in the [pandoc markdown
specification](authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#tables).

## Advanced Layout

You can center content on a slide by adding the `.flexbox` and
`.vcenter` attributes to the slide title. For example:

    ## Dinner {.flexbox .vcenter}

You can horizontally center content by enclosing it in a `div` tag with
class `centered`. For example:

    <div class="centered">
    This text is centered.
    </div>

You can do a two-column layout using the `columns-2` class. For example:

    <div class="columns-2">
      ![Image](image.png)

      - Bullet 1
      - Bullet 2
      - Bullet 3
    </div>

Note that content will flow across the columns so if you want to have
an image on one side and text on the other you should make sure that the
image has sufficient height to force the text to the other side of the
slide.

## Text Color

You can color content using base color classes red, blue, green, yellow,
and gray (or variations of them e.g. red2, red3, blue2, blue3, etc.).
For example:

    <div class="red2">
    This text is red
    </div>

## Presenter Mode

A separate presenter window can also be opened (ideal for when you are
presenting on one screen but have another screen that's private to you).
The window stays in sync with the main presentation window and also
shows presenter notes and a thumbnail of the next slide. To enable
presenter mode add `?presentme=true` to the URL of the presentation, for
example:

    mypresentation.html?presentme=true

The presenter mode window will open and will always re-open with the
presentation until it's disabled with:

    mypresentation.html?presentme=false

To add presenter notes to a slide you include it within a "notes" `div`.
For example:

    <div class="notes">
    This is my note.
    - It can contain markdown
    - like this list
    </div>

## Printing and PDF Output

You can print an ioslides presentation from within browsers that have
good support for print CSS (i.e. as of this writing Google Chrome has
the best support). Printing maintains most of the visual styles of the
HTML version of the presentation.

To create a PDF version of a presentation you can use Print to PDF from
Google Chrome.

## Figure Options

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within ioslides presentations:

* `fig_width` and  `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (7x5 is used by default)

* `fig_retina` Specifies the scaling to perform for retina displays (defaults to 2, which currently works for all widely used retina displays). Note that this only takes effect if you are using knitr >= 1.5.21. Set to `null` to prevent retina scaling.

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        fig_width: 7
        fig_height: 6
        fig_caption: true
    ---


## MathJax Equations

By default [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) scripts are included in ioslides presentations for rendering LaTeX and MathML equations. You can use the `mathjax` option to control how MathJax is included:

* Specify "default" to use an https URL from the official MathJax CDN.

* Specify "local" to use a local version of MathJax (which is copied into the output directory). Note that when using "local" you also need to set the `self_contained` option to false.

* Specify an alternate URL to load MathJax from another location.

* Specify null to exclude MathJax entirely.

For example, to use a local copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        mathjax: local
        self_contained: false
    ---

To use a self-hosted copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        mathjax: "http://example.com/mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
    ---

To exclude MathJax entirely:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        mathjax: null
    ---

## Document Dependencies

By default R Markdown produces standalone HTML files with no external dependencies, using data: URIs to incorporate the contents of linked scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos. This means you can share or publish the file just like you share Office documents or PDFs. If you'd rather have keep depenencies in external files you can specify `self_contained: false`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        self_contained: false
    ---

Note that even for self contained documents MathJax is still loaded externally (this is necessary because of it's size). If you want to serve MathJax locally then you should specify `mathjax: local` and `self_contained: false`.

One common reason keep dependencies external is for serving R Markdown documents from a website (external dependencies can be cached separately by browsers leading to faster page load times). In the case of serving multiple R Markdown documents you may also want to consolidate dependent library files (e.g. Bootstrap, MathJax, etc.) into a single directory shared by multiple documents. You can use the `lib_dir` option to do this, for example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        self_contained: false
        lib_dir: libs
    ---

## Advanced Customization

### Includes

You can do more advanced customization of output by including additional HTML content or by replacing the core pandoc template entirely. To include content in the document header or before/after the document body you use the `includes` option as follows:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        includes:
          in_header: header.html
          before_body: doc_prefix.html
          after_body: doc_suffix.html
    ---

### Custom Templates

You can also replace the underlying pandoc template using the `template` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        template: quarterly_report.html
    ---

Consult the documentation on [pandoc templates](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/templates.html) for additional details on templates. You can also study the [default HTML template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.html) as an example.

### Pandoc Arguments

If there are pandoc features you want to use that lack equivilants in the YAML options described above you can still use them by passing custom `pandoc_args`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      ioslides_presentation:
        pandoc_args: [
          "--title-prefix", "Foo",
          "--id-prefix", "Bar"
        ]
    ---

Documentation on all available pandoc arguments can be found in the [pandoc user guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#options).

## Shared Options

If you want to specify a set of default options to be shared by multiple documents within a directory you can include a file named `_output.yaml` within the directory. Note that no YAML delimeters or enclosing output object are used in this file. For example:

**\_output.yaml**

```yaml
ioslides_presentation:
  widescreen: true
  smaller: true
```

All documents located in the same directory as `_output.yaml` will inherit it's options. Options defined explicitly within documents will override those specified in the shared options file.
