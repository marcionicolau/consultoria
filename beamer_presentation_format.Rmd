## Overview

To create a Beamer presentation from R Markdown you specify the `beamer_presentation` output format in the front-matter of your document. You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the `#` and `##` heading tags (you can also create a new slide without a header using a horizontal rule (`----`). For example here's a simple
slide show:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: beamer_presentation
    ---

    # In the morning

    ## Getting up

    - Turn off alarm
    - Get out of bed

    ## Breakfast

    - Eat eggs
    - Drink coffee

    # In the evening

    ## Dinner

    - Eat spaghetti
    - Drink wine

    ----

    ## Going to sleep

    - Get in bed
    - Count sheep

Within R Markdown documents that generate PDF output you can use raw LaTeX and even define LaTeX macros. See the documentation on [Raw TeX](authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#raw-tex) for details.

## Incremental Bullets

You can render bullets incrementally by adding the `incremental` option:

    ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        incremental: true
    ---

If you want to render bullets incrementally for some slides but not
others you can use this syntax:

    > - Eat eggs
    > - Drink coffee

## Themes

You can specify Beamer themes using the `theme`, `colortheme`, and `fonttheme` options:

   ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        theme: "AnnArbor"
        colortheme: "dolphin"
        fonttheme: "structurebold"
    ---

## Table of Contents and Slide Level

The `toc` option specifies that a table of contents should be included at the beginning of the presentation (only level 1 headers will be included in the table of contents). For example:

    ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        toc: true
    ---

The `slide_level` option defines the heading level that defines individual slides.  By default this is the highest header level in the hierarchy that is followed immediately by content, and not another header, somewhere in the document. This default can be overridden by specifying an explicit `slide_level`:

    ---
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        slide_level: 2
    ---

## Figure Options

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within Beamer presentations:

* `fig_width` and `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (6 x 4.5 is used by default)

* `fig_crop` controls whether the the pdfcrop utility (if available) is automatically applied to pdf figures (this is true by default).

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions (this is true by default).

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        fig_width: 7
        fig_height: 6
        fig_caption: true
    ---

## Syntax Highlighting

The `highlight` option specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", and "haddock" (specify null to prevent syntax highlighting):

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        highlight: tango
    ---


## Advanced Customization

### Keeping Intermediate TeX

R Markdown documents are converted to PDF by first converting to a TeX file and then calling the LaTeX engine to convert to PDF. By default this TeX file is removed, however if you want to keep it (e.g. for an article submission) you can specify the `keep_tex` option. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        keep_tex: true
    ---

### Includes

You can do more advanced customization of PDF output by including additional LaTeX directives and/or content or by replacing the core pandoc template entirely. To include content in the document header or before/after the document body you use the `includes` option as follows:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        includes:
          in_header: header.tex
          before_body: doc_prefix.tex
          after_body: doc_suffix.tex
    ---

### Custom Templates

You can also replace the underlying pandoc template using the `template` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        template: quarterly_report.tex
    ---

Consult the documentation on [pandoc templates](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/templates.html) for additional details on templates. You can also study the [default Beamer template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.beamer) as an example.

### Pandoc Arguments

If there are pandoc features you want to use that lack equivilants in the YAML options described above you can still use them by passing custom `pandoc_args`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      beamer_presentation:
        pandoc_args: [
          "--no-tex-ligatures"
        ]
    ---

Documentation on all available pandoc arguments can be found in the [pandoc user guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#options).

## Shared Options

If you want to specify a set of default options to be shared by multiple documents within a directory you can include a file named `_output.yaml` within the directory. Note that no YAML delimeters or enclosing output object are used in this file. For example:

**\_output.yaml**

```yaml
beamer_presentation:
  toc: true
  fig_width: 7
  fig_height: 6
```

All documents located in the same directory as `_output.yaml` will inherit it's options. Options defined explicitly within documents will override those specified in the shared options file.
