## Changes in v2

The current implementation of R Markdown (v2) is an evolution of the original implementation, which was not based on pandoc but rather the [markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/markdown) package.  Moving to pandoc brings many new features to R Markdown however carries some minor incompatibilities with the previous implementation that are described below.

### Markdown Syntax

The following changes to markdown syntax were made in R Markdown v2:

1. The syntax for superscript now requires a closing ^ (e.g. `superscript^2^`).
2. The WordPress-style LaTeX equation syntax (e.g. `$latex <equation>$`) is no longer supported.
3. Markdown is rendered even if it's contained within HTML tags.

### Knitr Caching

One other important change relates to the use of the [knitr cache](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/cache/). When R Markdown knits documents it explicitly configures the knitr cache to use a directory based on the name of the input file (e.g. `inputfile_cache`). If you are setting an explicit cache directory within your document (e.g. via `opts_chunk$set(cache.path = ...))`) you should remove this code and rely on R Markdown to set the cache directory.


## Continuing to Use v1

If you are using RStudio you can force RStudio to render documents using R Markdown v1 by adding the following special comment to your source file:

<pre>&lt;!-- rmarkdown v1 --&gt;</pre>

For rendering R Markdown v1 documents outside of RStudio you can continue to use the [markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/markdown) package.
